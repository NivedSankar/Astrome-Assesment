# Astrome-Assesment
This HTML and CSS code creates a webpage with a chart container (#chart-container) containing five bars with different colors and initial heights. The code includes a DOCTYPE declaration, HTML opening tag, head section, body section, and script section. The chart container has a dark background color, border, and overflow hidden. The script section initiates an animation by resetting the graph and setting an interval. The animation is stopped by clearing the interval. The bars are reset to their initial height and stopped any ongoing animation. The DOMContentLoaded Event Listener calls resetGraph() when the page is loaded to set the initial state of the bars. The CSS section styles the chart container, bars, and buttons with specific positioning, colors, and transforms. The button interaction involves the start, reset, and stop buttons. The JavaScript section stores the interval ID for the animation, tracks the animation running, and represents the initial height for the bars.
